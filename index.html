    <p>If the hope of giving
      is to love the living,
      the giver risks madness
      in the act of giving.
      <br>
      Some such lesson I seemed to see
      in the faces that surrounded me.
      <br>
      Needy and blind, unhopeful, unlifted,
      what gift would give them the gift to be gifted?
      The giver is no less adrift
      than those who are clamouring for the gift.
      <br>
      If they cannot claim it, if it is not there,
      if their empty fingers beat the empty air
      and the giver goes down on his knees in prayer
      knows that all of his giving has been for naught
      and that nothing was ever what he thought
      and turns in his guilty bed to stare
      at the starving multitudes standing there
      and rises from bed to curse at heaven,
      he must yet understand that to whom much is given
      much will be taken, and justly so:
      I cannot tell how much I owe.
